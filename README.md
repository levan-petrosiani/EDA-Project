# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Description
This project showcases my skills in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **MySQL**. I analyzed a dataset to derive insights and demonstrate SQL capabilities. The project includes data cleaning, preprocessing, and querying steps to make the dataset analysis-ready and to extract meaningful patterns.

## Features
- SQL-based data cleaning and transformation
- Analysis of data distributions, trends, and relationships
- Ready-to-use SQL queries for generating insights

## Files in This Repository
- `EDA.sql`: The SQL script containing all the EDA queries.
- `data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis (if included).

## Prerequisites
- **MySQL Server**: To execute the SQL script.
- **SQL Workbench**: For running and testing queries.
- Basic knowledge of SQL commands.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/levan-petrosiani/EDA-Project.git
   cd EDA-Project
